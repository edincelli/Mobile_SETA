<b> Mobile Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA) Artifact </b>
</p align="center">
  
Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA) programs are designed to enhance an organization's security posture by equipping employees with the knowledge and skills needed to recognize and address security threats, such as phishing and social engineering (Dincelli & Chengalur-Smith, 2020). However, SETA programs are often implemented using a one-size-fits-all approach that does not account for unique user characteristics (D’Arcy & Hovav, 2008) and the distinct security challenges posed by different platforms or devices (Tyagi et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, SETA programs specifically tailored to address mobile device security remain rare. This represents a critical gap, particularly given the growing reliance on mobile devices driven by remote work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) trends (Patten & Harris, 2013). In both personal and professional contexts, mobile-specific threats demand specialized strategies and targeted training to ensure effective risk mitigation.

This project aims to address this gap by developing a mobile SETA artifact specifically designed to tackle the unique challenges of securing mobile devices. The mobile SETA artifact focuses on enhancing mobile security awareness and mindfulness to protect sensitive information in a mobile-first environment and addresses issues such as app permissions, mobile-specific malware, insecure networks, romance and finance scams.

To achieve this, the mobile SETA artifact engages users through an interactive, game-like experience that utilizes scenario-based training. This approach not only improves users’ awareness but also fosters mindfulness by highlighting the differences between secure and insecure behaviors in a mobile context. Users navigate realistic mobile security challenges, such as identifying phishing attempts in SMS messages, configuring secure app settings, and managing permissions effectively. The goal is to deepen users' understanding of mobile-specific threats while equipping them with practical, hands-on skills to mitigate risks in a dynamic and immersive learning environment.

<b> Development Platform: </b>
</p align="left">
Mobile SETA is developed using the Unity game development engine. Unity is selected for its robust development capabilities, scalability, and cross-platform support. Unity’s advanced 3D and 2D frameworks enable the creation of immersive and realistic training scenarios that enhance user engagement and learning outcomes. Unity also facilitates the integration of gamified features to further improve user engagement and support diverse experimental conditions. Unity’s modular architecture supports easy scalability, making it easy to implement future updates and add new training modules as needed. Additionally, Unity allows deployment across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, web, and desktop, ensuring that Mobile SETA is accessible to a wide audience.

<b> Gamified Mindfulness-Based Training Approach: </b>
</p align="left">
Mindfulness is a psychological state characterized by heightened awareness and focused attention on present experiences (Langer, 1989). Studies have shown that mindfulness techniques enhance individuals’ ability to dynamically allocate attention and improve contextual awareness, thereby increasing their ability to identify phishing emails (Jensen et al., 2017). Research further suggests that mindfulness, along with an individual's affective state, influences their preference for systematic processing, ultimately leading to greater accuracy in phishing detection (Bera & Kim, 2025).

Mindfulness-based interventions have been widely implemented in smartphone applications for various domains, including depression relapse prevention and addiction management (Creswell, 2017). However, there is currently no dedicated mindfulness program designed to address security and privacy-related threats. Integrating gamification into mindfulness-based SETA programs could enhance engagement and retention by leveraging interactive challenges, feedback mechanisms, and reward systems (Lee at al., 2025). Building on this, mSETA aims to provide a mindfulness-based intervention to immerse users in realistic security and privacy-related threat scenarios and encourage sustained attention and awareness.

What sets mSETA apart from traditional internet- and smartphone-based mindfulness programs is its use of realistic simulations that closely replicate real-world mobile-based social engineering attacks. Unlike passive SETA methods, mSETA guides users through each stage of an attack, allowing them to actively experience the unfolding events and understand the consequences of their decisions. By immersing users in these interactive scenarios, mSETA fosters heightened awareness and cultivates a sustained state of mindfulness, reinforcing security-conscious behavior over a longer period of time.
